Nothing special needed to run it. Just open index.html in firefox. You can run it in Chrome as well, but you'll need to start a webserver because Chrome doesn't like running this sort of stuff from file:///


==Node Commands==
npm install - Install necessary dependencies
npm run start - Start an http server for debugging on localhost
npm run build-css - Compile sass into css
npm run watch-css - Watch folder for changes and run build-css if needed
